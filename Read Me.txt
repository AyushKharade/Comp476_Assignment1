Details:

There are 6 NPCs in total in the scene, which uses the Robot Kyle model from the lab materials.
It uses a capsule collider for collisions, and Unity's collision functions are used to Tag / Unfreeze NPCs.

Each NPC has a Sphere on top of their head indicating their behaviors.
- Red Sphere: NPC who is chasing
- Green Sphere: NPC who is fleeing
- Blue Sphere: NPC who is frozen.

Game starts with all NPCs being a green sphere, they will wander, until the Game.cs script randomly selects one NPC to be the tagged NPC.


Behaviors:
- Kinematic Seek (Chasing NPC)
- Kinematic Wander
- Kinematic Arrive (unfreezing NPCs)
- Align Orientation


Once game starts: (Green NPC means the ones who are running and not yet frozen)

- All other NPCs are notified of the NPC who is chasing them
- If a green NPC is not being actively seeked they will wander.
- If a green NPC is being actively seeked they will flee.
- If a green NPC is set as 'Always Flee' in the inspector, they will always flee, even if they are not being seeked.
- If a green NPC is tagged, they turn blue and wait until either the game ends or someone else frees them.

- If a green NPC is set as 'Allow Unfreezing', if they are not being seeked, instead of wandering, they can unfreeze other NPCS
  To do this, they have a secondary Target, and they use the 'Arrive' behavior to reach them.

- A red (chasing) NPC gets a bit faster everytime they tag someone. Also they get faster incrementally, if they havent tagged anyone for 10 seconds.
  This is done to make sure that the game ends eventually and restarts  with someone else as the tagged NPC.

- A red NPC, every 5 seconds re-calculates to find the closest NPC, so that if original target got far, it would seek the closest one.



Aligning:
- Chaser NPC has to align their orientation towards target in order to seek at max velocity unless they are close to their target.
- If a chaser NPC is not facing their target, they only move at 50% of their max speed.


Animations:
- Animations if used might sometime bug the program, these are the animations that came with the robot model from lab material.
- To use animations simple check 'Allow Animations' boolean in the inspector for every NPC.




Additional Details:
- Debug raycasts are drawn to help recognise behavior on screen.
- Chasing NPC has a green ray cast towards the target, to show the direction.
- Chasing NPC has a red ray cast to show their forward direction.

- NPCs who are trying to unfreeze their targets have a blue raycasts to show their direction.
- Make sure to have gizmons enabled in game view to see these raycasts.
